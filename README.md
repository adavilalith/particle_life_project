# Particle Life Project

This a simple celluar automata project that simulations attraction and repulsion forces between prarticles based of the color of the particles. These simulations lead to development of patterns are have a resemblance to celluar life.

This project was inspired by the below video

## About the project
The project is written in java. It uses javas in built windowing and drawing tools such as JFrame, awt, swing, etc.

Below is a video of the project being run: 

[!(Project Demo)()

## Pending Features
1)adding gui
2)making no of partricles, attraction, etc changable and randomizable for better simulation searching
